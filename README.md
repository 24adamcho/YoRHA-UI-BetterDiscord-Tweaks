# YoRHa-UI-Tweaks
Tweaks for [AccraZed's YoRHa-UI](https://github.com/AccraZed/YoRHA-UI-BetterDiscord) for BetterDiscord.

## FAQ
### Does it work on YoRHa-Dark?
Probably not, I didn't try because I think the dark theme presented goes against the original palette. But at the top of the css file is a similar list of colors used in the original theme file, so you could probably copy over the YoRHa-Dark palette over and replace it.

### Why??
There were some inconsistencies in the UI (some boxes having borders, text being too dark). This theme intends to fix some of the issues I saw in AccraZed's **`v1.4`** release. And add some of my personal taste.

### What's changed?
Many things. Half of which I can't remember.
Comment out (highlight all lines you want removed and hit `ctrl /` in BetterDiscord's native theme editor) any changes you don't want. 
The changes progress from 'I think this could look better' to 'total conversion' the further down the file you go.

### Why is it arranged in a schizophrenic mess?
I wrote it over the course of 3 days in a hyperfocused haze. Please forgive me.
