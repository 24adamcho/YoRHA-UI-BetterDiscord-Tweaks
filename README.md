# YoRHa-UI-Tweaks
Tweaks for [AccraZed's YoRHa-UI](https://github.com/AccraZed/YoRHA-UI-BetterDiscord) for BetterDiscord.

## FAQ

### Why??
There were some inconsistencies in the UI (some boxes having borders, text being too dark). This theme intends to fix some of the issues I saw in AccraZed's **`v1.4`** release.

### What's changed?
A full list of changes can be found in Tweaks.md. 
Comment out (highlight all lines you want removed and hit `ctrl /` in BetterDiscord's native theme editor) any changes you don't want. The changes progress from 'I think this could look better' to 'total conversion' the further down the file you go.

### Why is it arranged in a schizophrenic mess?
I wrote it over the course of 3 days in a hyperfocused haze. Please forgive me.
